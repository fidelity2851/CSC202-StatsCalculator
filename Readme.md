# CSC202-StatsCalculator

This project is a solution to an assignment from **CSC 202 Practical** in school. The goal of the assignment is to compute key statistical values like **mean**, **standard deviation**, and **variance** based on a set of user-provided data. The project is implemented in VB.NET.

## Assignment Overview

**Course**: CSC 202  
**Assignment**: Practical Assignment 1  
**Topic**: Statistical Calculation of Mean, Standard Deviation, and Variance

### Description

The assignment involves writing a program that asks the user for the following information:

- Department
- Full Name
- Registration Number
- Group Number
- Serial Number

The program then prompts the user to input a series of data points, from which the following are calculated:

- **Mean**: The average of the data points.
- **Standard Deviation**: A measure of how spread out the numbers are from the mean.
- **Variance**: The square of the standard deviation.

## Features

- Collects user details and a series of numeric data points.
- Calculates and displays the following:
  - Mean
  - Standard Deviation
  - Variance
- Outputs a table showing each data point and its mean deviation.
